                    Plant corn hybrids with resistance to the disease, <br> 
                    crop rotation and plowing debris into soil may reduce levels of inoculum in the soil but may not provide control in areas where the disease is prevalent <br>
                     foliar fungicides may be economically viable for some high yeilding susceptible hybrids <br>

                    The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids; 
                    application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity; 
                    fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, 
                    generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf.

                    Disease management tactics include using resistant corn hybrids, 
                    conventional tillage where appropriate, and crop rotation. 
                    Foliar fungicides can be effective if economically warranted. 
                    Typically they are only profitable on susceptible inbreds or susceptible hybrids under a combination of high risk conditions with high yield potential, 
                    prolonged humid conditions, and evidence of disease development.
